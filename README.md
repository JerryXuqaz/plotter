# simplest pen-plotter
A simple plotter build with Raspberry Pi.

This project only takes less than 35$ excluding raspberry pi. The main material is raspberry pi, three motors, wood blocks connected between motors, a platform and some easy electric circuit.
 
This project does not require much knowledge about building a technology device but more about a "toy" people could play with. It is a special experiment, you could build your own device based on what other people had finished. During the process you will find many new problems that you need to solve yourself.(depened on different people)
